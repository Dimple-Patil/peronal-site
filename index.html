    <p>Human communication was initiated with the origin of speech approximately 100,000 BCE. The first means of communication was, of course, the human voice but about 3,200 BC writing was invented in Iraq and Egypt.</p>

    <p>Communication history is a domain of inquiry that attends to practices, ideas, and fields of communication in the past and brings historical sensibilities to bear on communication research and theory in the present. In attending to practices, communication history investigates the full range of mediated and face-to-face forms of symbolic exchange and dissemination - from conservation and oratory to mails, journalism, television, and the Internet. It also looks to the intersections of social communication with phenomena like an empire, nation-building, organizational publicity, international development, or the cultural production of gender, race, and power. In attending to ideas, communication history inquires into the meaning, influence, and production of concepts and theories. It also provides a framework for investigating and classifying theoretical frameworks, categorizing them, for instance, by their own understanding and use of history.  In attending to fields, meanwhile, communication history investigates organized realms of inquiry, research, and education across traditions and disciplines - from journalism/newspaper science, speech, and public opinion research to a full range of subfields within contemporary communication studies. </p>
